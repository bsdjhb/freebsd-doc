The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

During the last quarter, we welcomed Ã„lven (alven@) and Tiago Gashiba (tiga@) as new ports committers, and said goodbye to six committers.
We also promoted Dan Langille (dvl@) as a full portmgr member after successfully being on the lurker program.
