The man:vt[4] console font "gallant" was extended in -CURRENT and 14-STABLE.
This increased the Unicode glyph count from 502 to more than 4500.
Old-timers know and love this font from watching Sun SPARCstations boot.

Major additions:

* Greek
* Cyrillic
* International Phonetic Association Extensions
* Extended Latin characters
* Zapf Dingbats
* Tons of arrows
* Tons of mathematical symbols
* Letterlike symbols and enclosed alphanumerics
* Pixel-perfect box drawing
* Currency symbols
* More punctuation
* Just enough Katakana to say コンニチハ
* Powerline glyphs in the Private Use Area at U+e0a0

Your help is needed to add more languages.

But wait, there is more!
You do not bother with console fonts and use X11 exclusively?
Get that gallant feeling with the new port package:x11-fonts/gallant[] and run

 xterm -fa '' -fn '*-gallant-*'

To inspect the available glyphs under X11, run

 xfd -fn '*-gallant-*'
