RISC-V support represents a significant milestone in the evolution of this open-source operating system.
FreeBSD was the first operating system to have bootable in-tree support for RISC-V, underscoring its commitment to embracing emerging hardware architectures.

FreeBSD currently supports the following platforms:

* HiFive Unleashed (SiFive FU540)
* HiFive Unmatched (SiFive FU740)
* StarFive VisionFive 2 (StarFive JH7110)
* Spike
* QEMU

// The "Supported Devices" section of the release notes.
// Generally processor-independent, with conditional text
// inclusion handling any architecture-dependent text.

// Within each subsection describing a class of hardware
// (i.e. Ethernet interfaces), list broad groups of devices
// alphabetically as paragraphs sorted alphabetically (frequently
// these groups will be arranged by manufacturer, i.e. 3Com
// Ethernet interfaces).

// Where applicable, a "Miscellaneous" section may follow all
// other named sections.

// These guidelines are not hard-and-fast rules, and exceptions
// will occur.  Following these guidelines (vague as they may be)
// is highly recommended to try to keep the formatting of
// this section consistent.

// We give manpage references using the &man entities where
// possible.  If a driver has no manpage (and consequently no
// &man entity, we simply give the name of the driver).
// Please avoid doing &man entity conversions unless you
// know for sure that an entity and manpage exist; sweeps through
// this file to fix "missed" conversions are likely to break the
// build.

[[support]]
== Supported Devices

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by each device driver in FreeBSD.
If the driver in question has a manual page in the FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here.
Information on usage, configuration, and specific models of supported devices, controllers, etc. can be found in the manual pages.

[NOTE]
====
The device lists in this document are being generated automatically from FreeBSD manual pages.
This means that some devices, which are supported by multiple drivers, may appear multiple times.
